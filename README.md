# Demystifying confidential computing

## Introduction
This repository contains the source material for Menacit's presentation
"Demystifying confidential computing", first presented at SEC-T 2024.
  
A rendered version of all the presentation can be previewed [here](https://t.menacit.se/dcc).  
  
See "resources" directory for help to setup a SEV-SNP lab environment!
  
**The material is actively being developed -
Feedback and contributions are warmly welcomed!**


## How to contribute
Besides using Github issues to suggest changes, improvements or request clarifications, feel free
to fork the repository and submit a pull request.  

The presentation relies on [scenskrack](https://github.com/doctor-love/scenskrack) to generate
PDF/HTML versions of the slides and bundle things into ZIP files. Remember to include yourself in
the author section and add attribution for any images used in slides. All content included should
be available under an "OSI compatible"
[Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) (BY, BY-SA or CC0).
AI generated content should not be contributed, due to messy legal situation. For tracking of
images and other large assets, the [Git LFS extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used.  
  
PRs containing photos of cats and/or dogs will be rejected - there are already to many of them on
the Internet! ;-)
